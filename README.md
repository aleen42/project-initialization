<h2 align="center">PI (Project Initialization)</h2>

**PI**, standing for *Project Initialization*, is a simple shell script tool for constructing personal projects (temporary NPM projects) in one step, like integrating Webpack, Babel, React, ESLint, Unit-Testing Frameworks, etc.

As a common share project, you can use it directly. The first step you should do is to install it by cloning the project to the local disk recursively as there is a sub-module for managing configuration files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleen42/project-initialization.git --recursive
```

And then, make sure that you have your *Node* environment installed and configured correctly. After checking this, the shell script can be easily run with the following snippet:

```bash
node init.es6
```

For more information about usage of the script, you can pass it a parameter `-h` or `--help`.
